# Project Execution Plan: KetoHouse.com MVP

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-07-25
**Related Docs:** [PRD.md](./PRD.md), [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md)

## 1. Philosophy

This project will be executed with a "stupid simple" philosophy for the MVP. We will prioritize building a solid, static foundation that delivers immediate value to the user and can be robustly built upon in future phases. We will avoid premature optimization and complexity.

## 2. Development Phases & Milestones

The project will be broken down into four main phases, each with a clear milestone.

### Phase 1: Foundation & Setup (Milestone: Dev Environment Ready)
- **Goal:** Prepare the local development environment, set up the Astro project, and establish the basic structure.
- **Key Activities:**
    - Initialize the Astro project with Tailwind CSS.
    - Configure project settings, including linting and formatting tools.
    - Create the basic file and folder structure as outlined in `CLAUDE.md`.
    - Set up the GraphQL client for connecting to the headless WordPress instance.

### Phase 2: Core Content & UI Development (Milestone: All Pages and Components Built)
- **Goal:** Build all static pages and reusable components required for the MVP.
- **Key Activities:**
    - Develop the main `BaseLayout` with the site header and footer.
    - Build static pages: Homepage, Mind & Body, Meal Planners.
    - Create the dynamic page templates for Recipes and Science articles (`[...slug].astro`).
    - Develop all UI components (e.g., `RecipeCard`, `ArticlePreview`, `Button`).
    - Implement the placeholder `Courses` and `Shop` pages with their n8n-powered forms.

### Phase 3: Content Integration & Styling (Milestone: Site is Content-Complete and Visually Polished)
- **Goal:** Populate the site with content from the headless CMS and apply final styling.
- **Key Activities:**
    - Connect the dynamic pages to the WordPress GraphQL API.
    - Ensure all data (text, images, tags) is correctly fetched and displayed.
    - Implement the filtering logic for recipes on the recipe listing page.
    - Apply Tailwind CSS classes across all components and pages to match the desired visual design.
    - Address any styling issues with content rendered from WordPress (e.g., using `@tailwindcss/typography` or global styles).

### Phase 4: Testing, Deployment & Launch (Milestone: MVP Live on Render.com)
- **Goal:** Ensure the site is bug-free, performant, and successfully deployed.
- **Key Activities:**
    - Conduct thorough testing across different browsers and devices.
    - Verify that all links, forms, and pages work as expected.
    - Configure the project for deployment on Render.com.
    - Set up the build pipeline and deploy the site.
    - Perform a final post-launch check.

## 3. Post-MVP Strategy

Upon successful launch of the MVP, the project will transition into a cycle of maintenance and planning for Phase 2. Key activities will include:
- **Monitoring:** Track the success metrics outlined in the PRD (user engagement, email signups).
- **Gathering Feedback:** Collect user feedback to inform the roadmap.
- **Planning Phase 2:** Begin the detailed technical design and task breakdown for integrating Supabase and interactive features.
